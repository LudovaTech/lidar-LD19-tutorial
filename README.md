# Tutorial on lidar LD19

LD19 is a lowcost lidar that we (LudovaTech) used to the Robocup Junior competition. We find out that it works very well for our needs but that there was no good documentation or tutorial on the web. We succed to make it work after some long days of work. Here is how we did it :

## Overview

![lidar LD19](./images/lidar-LD19.jpg)

The LD19 lidar utilizes Direct Time-of-Flight (DTOF) technology, which measures the time interval between emitting and receiving a signal. According to the manufacturerâ€™s documentation, the LD19 can perform up to 5,000 measurements per second.

> [!NOTE]
> In our application, we observed that one complete rotation of the lidar takes approximately 130 milliseconds, resulting in around 600 measurement points per loop.

## Communication interface

You can use a `JST ZH 4-pin` connector to link the LiDAR to other components, facilitating both power supply and data reception. The interface details are outlined in the table below:

| Name and Type |  Voltage  |   Comments   |
| :------------ | :-------: | :----------- |
| **Tx** (output UART), lidar data output at `230400` baud rate | 0V - 3.5V typical: 3.3V | This lidar only sends data, not receives it, hence the absence of an Rx port. |
| **PWM** (input), control the speed of the built-in motor, the current lidar speed is indicated in the data sent | 0V - 3.3V | If manual control of the lidar speed is not required, the designated pin can be set to ground (GND) upon initiation of the lidar device and maintained in this state throughout its operation. (More informations on *manual* speed control in the [real documentation](#links))|
| **GND** (power supply) | 0V | - |
| **5V** (power supply) | 4.5V - 5.5V typical: 5V | - |

The LD19 uses UART protocol for data communication with the following settings:

- **Baud Rate:** 230400
- **Data Length:** 8 bits
- **Stop Bit:** 1
- **Parity:** None
- **Flow Control:** None

> [!TIP]
> For Arduino users, simply set the baud rate to `230400`. The other parameters are set to the correct values by default.

> [!IMPORTANT] The Lidar LD19 begins transmitting measurement data as soon as its rotation stabilizes, which typically takes two to three seconds. There is no need to send any commands to initiate this process, and in fact, you cannot send any commands to do so.
